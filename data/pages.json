I've never played at tournament level, but have ran a number of kitchen table groups.</p><p>When I returned to the game for the third time in 2010, I began to paint on my cards. I've never done much with painting or sketching, so these early attempts never got me through the early shedding hump.</p><p>Eight years later on my fourth return, I had just gotten back into cubing. I like to make insane personal goals, so I started to alter every card in the cube.</p><p>Having the cube to rely on took out most of my procrastination. Rather than fret over what to paint and what card to alter, I forced myself to grab a random card and go with the first idea I had. It worked fairly well</p><p>While I'm still not a good artist, I do well enough to include my alters in my decks. I wanted a way to display my decklists with my altered cards. I also wanted a central gallery space to show off what I've altered.</p><p>This site is my place to make a web app I wish was available for MTG alterists who deckbuild. I'll be exploring this tech stack anyway, especially using Vue and Mongo. I intend to add several game tools such as a multiplayer life tracker.</p><p>I've never been a consistant writer so a blog is beyond my level of committment. I will set up a game report section to log my EDH games. Anything else will have to commit to being a unique page. I may start a separate altering process pages, but we'll see how ambitious I get 8 )></p>"

      "content": "<p>My goal in playing EDH is to have fun. Right off, we're not into CEDH. Power levels should aim for Jason Alt's 75% theory. Meaning decks should be very powerful without being able to win or lock the game down in the first five turns. The main baseline for power I use is to ask a question: \"Would I be able to play this deck in a four player game that includes a new player with a precon?\"</p><p>I do not ban any individual cards. If you have a banned card in your deck, please let the table know ahead of time and be ready to play a different deck if asked. I strongly discourage playing \"Sensai's Divining Top\" as it tends to waste everyone's time. I also discourage too many tutor effects. If you have a tutor, please know your deck and announce your tutor target before searching it up. If you dont know your targets in every situation, don't include the tutor. This is not CEDH.</p><p>Combo wins are encouraged. Games have to end, and we can always shuffle up and play again.</p><p>I have a couple of general ettiquite rules for keeping games moving at a good pace. First, please do any tutoring as early as possible. This means cracking fetches or topping (if you insist) at the end of your turn instead of waiting until just before your turn. You can change your mind if the gamestate changes before your turn. A good example is searching up your \"Sakura-Tribe Elder\" land early, but leaving Steve on the table as a blocker. This way, you can simply remove Steve at the beginning of your next turn and have the land already set. It's understood that any attacker will get chumped by Steve.</p><p>Additionally, please think about your next turn during other players' turns. Most of the time, you will have only one new piece of information when your turn starts. If you feel yourself falling into Analysis Paralysis, just make a play so the game can continue. Remember, in most games with 2-3 opponents, someone will react to whatever you do. Don't panic, act.</p>"

      "content": "<p>As with house rules, the mulligan I use is intended to get games started quicker with less shuffling. You still get a free first mulligan, but instead of shuffling between each draw, you take the next seven cards off the library.</p><p>Start by drawing seven cards. If you don't like your initial hand, set all cards aside and draw a new hand of seven cards without shuffling. You can keep these cards without putting anything on the bottom from your hand. If you need to mulligan again, add your hand to the first pile you set aside and draw the next seven. Repeat until you have a keepable hand.</p><p>After keeping a hand, shuffle all hands set aside into your library. Then if you took two or more mulligans, put that number of cards minus one on the bottom of your library. If you prefer to count number of hands drawn, its that number minus two cards.</p><p>For example, if you keep your third hand, put one card on the bottom of your library. If you keep your first or second hands, put no cards on the bottom. If you mulligan four times, that means you drew five hands and need to put three on the bottom at the end of this process. I find that this method gets a better balance of having games start quicker and reduces the number of non-hands, while having some discouragement to mulliganing forever into a god-hand.</p>"
